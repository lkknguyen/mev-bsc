## MEV-BSC

MEV-BSC is a bsc-geth fork adding additional functionality to the JSON-RPC for MEV. **Important: MEV-BSC only adds functionality targeted for searchers to get more data/perform more actions on the node, and does not add functionality for validators to include MEV bundles**

#### For bsc-geth usage and information, please visit the [bsc-geth README](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/blob/master/README.md)
